See the definition of Convention over configuration in Wikipedia . Disclaimer General We adopt lowerCamelCase for both functions and variables, which is against the rule of Google C++ Style Guide and PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code . However, to be consistent with the LeetCode OJ system, which uses lowerCamelCase for over 99% of the time, we stick with lowerCamelCase in this case. Remember the most important thing is to be consistent all the time. We omit importing and brackets, and this is for shorter paragraph. In a real situation, retain importing let you quickly know where is this function/variable from and brackets make the indentation safer, so you might keep both of them. C++ Code can't be compiled, it's just for demonstrating purposes. Even though there is auto keyword in C++, for types like int and char , we tend to explicitly declare them so people can have an idea of what the type is at first glance. However, you might use auto most of the time in the real world. We skip including. We use int to traverse the array most of the time for simplicity. However, you should note the difference between size_t and int , and in the real world, that matters. We omit std:: to access the standard library for a short paragraph. Java Code can't be compiled, it's just for demonstrating purposes. Even though there is var keyword in Java, for types like int and char , we tend to explicitly declare them so people can have an idea of what the type is at first glance. We skip importing. Python We omit prefixes like collections. and math. . However, this might not be a good practice. Just want to keep the paragraph short. We prefix private functions with _ and this might seem tedious. However, we tend to use something like Mypy and Pyre to do static type checking in the real world. We pass the argument --indent-size=2 to autopep8 for a better viewing experience. Fundamental Rules Class : UpperCamelCase Function : lowerCamelCase Variable : lowerCamelCase Constant : UPPERCASE with underline Field : lowerCamelCase Database : SELECT * FROM name_table Examples 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 // Class class MyClass { ... } // Function function myFunction () { ... } // Variable int myVariable ; // Constant #define MY_CONSTANT; // Database Table SELECT * FROM my_table Template Rules There should only be one public function. Declare the variables in the proper scope as slow as possible. Declare const variables as soon as possible. Declare ans as soon as possible. Since LeetCode is just an online judge system rather than a big project, we don't scatter all variables in different sections. However, we still sort the variables based on the time we first use each of them. Code section (there should be one blank line between each sections.) public boundary conditions initial variables There may be many kernels separated with one blank line, but there shouldn't be any blank line in each kernel. return private private variables private function(s) Schematic Template We use C++ to demo the idea. No blank lines between variables initialization. Blank one single line between each section. However, if there's no sec 12 , no blank line between sec 11 and sec 13 . If the last statement is not a paragraph ( for loop most of the case), then no blank lines between it and the return statement. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 class Solution { public : // There should only be one public function. func () { // (sec 0) boundary conditions // (sec 1) initial variables // (sec 10) constexpr/const (size/length) // (sec 11) ans // (sec 12) declaration & operation // (sec 13) purely declaration // (sec 2) kernels // (sec 3) modify original initial variables // (sec 4) kernels // (sec n) return } private : // private variables // private function(s) helper () { ... } dfs () { ... } }; Example ( 873.
